                        What started as a project to sell some app icons I made for my girlfriend has evolved into an e-commerce site for quality graphic design projects.

                <p>
                    With the release of widgets and more home screen customisation in Apple’s iOS/iPadOS 14 update, the online world exploded with custom app icons to give your homescreen a consistent feeling. The trouble is, everybody (including my girlfriend) flocked to Google Images for their icons, naturally meaning everyone’s home screens made a design fanatic like me want to die. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Eventually, I got so sick of looking at her home screen I rebuilt all her icons with a neon style. I can’t say with 100% honesty that she liked them as much as her old ones, but I certainly did.
                </p>
                
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../content/images/adrodex/adrodex1.png">
                    <p>I wanted to make her icons that looked professional and consistent, yet remained unique to her and the style of her phone.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    The whole experience got me thinking: I wanted to make a place for people to be able to download some of these app icons for themselves. This may or may not be because a number of other people asked about where they could get some icons for themselves.
                    <br>
                    Initially, the idea was to create a section of my site where people could select individual icons to create their own packs, but over time the idea dramatically evolved.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My mother (who runs <i>Manage My Bookkeeping</i>, which I did a branding for a while back), has wanted a site to be able to sell some business resources for a few years now, but never knew how best to do it. She’d often jokingly suggest to me that I build her a place to sell these products.
                    <br>
                    That sparked an idea to have a general digital marketplace to sell my products my family, friends or I wanted to sell, which could include my app icons. 
                    <br>
                    Although at the time of writing my mother’s products are not on Adrodex, the option is there for when she wants to use it.
                </p>
                
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../content/images/adrodex/adrodex2.png">
                    <p>The initial, very neon-themed concept vs. the current, production-ready concepts. The neon didn’t fit bookkeeping all too well.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    The first issue I had to cross with developing Adrodex was the substantial amount I had to learn to get it off the ground; I knew nothing about technical web development, handling payments, and general server-side stuff before I began. I just hoped that what I was conceptualising was possible. 
                    <br>
                    This presented a large issue of time; between working 30+ hours a week and spending most of my free time working on Morgann or Gravity, I had very little of it to spare to start a new project, let alone learn a new programming language and workflow style. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Then, (un?)fortunately, Brisbane went into complete lockdown again. It was only for a few days, but it gave me the time off work that I needed to jump start a new project (the exact same thing happened for Morgann, but for about 2 months). I already had decent concepts, so all I needed to do was develop the website and learn how to process payments.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I won’t dive too much into the technical aspects of Adrodex, but for those curious I used native HTML and CSS for the frame and styling of the site (loosely based around my own design framework, which I may release more on later), and Node.JS (Express) for the server-side. I also settled on Stripe as a payment partner because of its great API and amazing tutorials.
                </p>
                
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../content/images/adrodex/adrodex3.png">
                    <p>This was the original version of the store (left), and the version I made when I realised the original version wasn't going to cut it (right). Believe it or not, I considered myself good at interface design at the time.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    As of the time of release, Adrodex currently has my Neon Collection of app icons, which contains a slightly improved and vastly expanded lineup of app icons that I used for my girlfriend’s phone. I also have another, super sleek looking collection in the works, plans to make some sweet looking desktop backgrounds, and many plans for this project.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It was a lot of fun to make, and an excellent way to support what I do, plus get some funky content for yourself.
