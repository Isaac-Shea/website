                        Please note we require that, as a part of any request by an individual for access to personal information, the individual verifies their identity so that we may be satisfied that the request for access is being made by the individual concerned.

                    <li>
                        Please note that we are not required to give an individual access to personal information in circumstances where:
                        <ul>
                            <li>We reasonably believe that giving access would pose a serious threat to the life, health, or safety of any individual, group, or the public; </li>
                            <li>Giving access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals;</li>
                            <li>The request for access is frivolous or vexatious;</li>
                            <li>The information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between us and the individual, and would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings;</li>
                            <li>Giving access would reveal us in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations;</li>
                            <li>Giving access would be unlawful;</li>
                            <li>Denying access is required or authorised under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order;</li>
                            <li>

                                    <li>We have reason to suspect that unlawful activity, or misconduct of a serious nature, that relates to our functions or activities has been, is being, or may be engaged in;</li>
                                    <li>Giving access would be likely to prejudice the taking of appropriate action in relation to the matter;</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Giving access would be likely to prejudice one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, and enforcement body;</li>
                            <li>Giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within our services in connection with a commercially sensitive decision-making process.</li>
                        </ul>

                        Inaccurate information will be corrected upon receiving advice to this effect. To ensure confidentiality, details of an individual’s personal information will only be passed on the individual if we are satisfied that the information relates to the individual. From time to time, having regard to the purpose of the collection and use of personal information about individuals, we may contact individuals to seek confirmation that the personal information provided to us by the individual is accurate, up-to-date, and complete.

                    <li>
                        If we refuse to provide an individual with access to correct the personal information held by us about the individual, then we will provide reasons for such a refusal. Such reasons will set out the grounds for refusal, the mechanisms available to complain about the refusal and any other matters that are required by the Act.
