                    You know that moment when you annoy someone for years about redesigning their website and then one day they actually say yes? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Me too.

                    STiBaRC is a site wherein users can create posts and send them to other users, similar to Reddit and Facebook (although don't tell anybody I said that). STiBaRC has been a nice message board site that a friend of mine, Joshua Herron (or Herronjo) came up with years ago, and for the most part it's really cool.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But the design has always been... Well, painful.
                </p>

            <div class="embed-image">
                <img class="image" src="../../Assets/casestudies/morgann/morgannscreenshot1.png" alt="Embedded Image Title">
                <h3>A screenshot of the original  site as of early 2020. It hurts me.</h3>

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    This has been fine, though, because the site had been mostly a joke.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But then Herronjo decided he would like to turn it into something more, and I jokingly mentioned I'd redesign it with him if he wanted.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Much to my suprise, he accepted my offer. Soon after I was teamed up with another friend, Ben Border (or Bunnbuns), and we set to work.

                <h1>THE REDESIGN</h1>
                <h3>It's designer time!</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Now that we more or less had the go-ahead on the redesign, we set out to establish a new design. I had a couple of things that I wanted to make sure we nailed, so I designed my concepts around them.

                        <b>The Old Site:</b> As much as the old site pained me to look at, there was an essence to it that I wanted to <strike>salvage</strike> capture in the new design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>The Ecosystem:</b> Being a lot like me, the original STiBaRC Team created a new thing under the STiBaRC branding every weekend, it would seem, and I wanted a way to build them all into the main site. This, in my eyes, would also offer a differentiating point from other platforms.
