                <h1>I GOT BORED</h1>
                <h3><time datetime="2020-06-02">02 June, 2020</time></h3>
                
                <p>
                    Have you every felt like being a pain to your friends is just too much effort? Like there was a way to...automate insults?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A common issue, I know. But the world was in lockdown and I had nothing better to do (I say that as if I wasn't working on a game at the time). Anyways, my friends and I had an ongoing joke where we would insult a particular friend of ours at every chance we got, which naturally led to the need for a bot (of course) to do just that for us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I set it up so whenever he would post a message to our group server on <i>Discord</i> (basically a voice and text-messaging service, for those who don't know), Morgann would automatically reply with a random insult from the list I gave him.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="embed-image">
                <img class="image" src="../../Assets/casestudies/morgann/morgannscreenshot1.png" alt="Embedded Image Title">
                <h3>Morgann's ingenious insults in action. And who better to receive such a scathing remark than from Morgan Freeman himself.</h3>
            </div>
            
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Already, this was a brilliant addition to our server, but I wanted to take this a step further. So, naturally, I added a bunch of features.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Adding Insults:</b> I was sick of having to manually add insults to a save file myself, so I gave everyone the power to.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Adding Quotes:</b> Another running joke in our friend group is the stupid stuff we say when we're not thinking, so naturally I needed to have a system to store all of this, and show it on demand.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Targeting Someone Else:</b> Throwing insults at one friend is fun enough, but eventually we had the need to insult other people, so I let Morgann target other people, too.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    This all went well, however I had a couple of serious problems beginning to arise. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    First of all, I was running the entirety of Morgann off of my computer, which meant that once I went to bed other people couldn't add insults or target people. And because nobody except me has a normal sleeping pattern, this became a problem.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Secondly, everything was stored inside a couple of .txt files on my hard drive, which meant it was <i>very</i> easy to corrupt data if something went wrong.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And lastly, I thought other people would want to have Morgann on their servers, and because all the save data was global, I had a serious privacy issue.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <br>
            
            <div class="text">
                <h1>THE REWORK</h1>
                <h3>Welcome to Technical Territory</h3>
                
                <p>
                    It was fairly obvious to me that Morgann was in dire need of a rework, and so I set about doing this. There was a couple of things I wanted to change the second time around, though:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Planning:</b> The original Morgann was built around me learning Python, which meant it was messy and janky like nothing else, so I wanted to fix that with the rework.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Saving:</b> My biggest concern with storing everything in .txt files is that they cannot handle asynchronous saving requests. Because Discord handles messages asynchronously, though, this could cause a serious problem if two people were to add an insult at the same time because corruption and stuff.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Moderator Tools:</b> It had become clear to me by this point that Morgann could get fairly intrusive, so I wanted to allow moderators to dial back his annoyance if need be.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    To fix the biggest of these issues, saving, I decided to use a fully-fledged database to store everything, and eventually settled on an SQL database hosted through Heroku. Heroku is super neat because it hosts Morgann and the database, and I can access the database from on my computer, which meant I didn't have to guess how Morgann would function before uploading it. Also, it's free.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So with that sorted, I got to work on the new update, and less than a month later I for the most part completed Morgann, with the following features added:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Removing Insults & Quotes:</b> Everyone knows that one guy who always comes up with the worst stuff to add to the insult list (at least, I do), so I had to add the ability for moderators to remove insults and quotes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Random Insults & Quotes:</b> I'm not really sure about the logic behind the random insults, but it's basically the target feature but on-demand, I guess?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Insult & Quote Searching:</b> This one ties fairly closely into removing, because when you have 80 insults and quotes, things can get a bit hectic when randomly finding insults.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Other Mod Tools:</b> The people needed them, so I gave the ability to limit Morgann to a specific channel and add other roles to utilise mod tools (normally only server owners can use them).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <br>
            
            <div class="text">
                <h1>WHAT I LEARNED</h1>
                
                <p>
                    In the end, I learned quite a large amount from this project, actually.
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Python:</b> I pretty much learned Python over the course of about a month and a half to code Morgann, so that was nice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Quick Project Turnover is Great:</b> As I said, I only worked on Morgann for about a month and a half before completing him, which is the nicest feeling.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    So that's all there is to know about Morgann, really. He was never really intended to be much in the way of usefulness, but through him I learned a bunch and made my friends laugh, so I see that as a win-win.
                </p>
